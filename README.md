# repetitive.js

**PLEASE NOTE! This library is still in production! It will be expanded in the future but for now - you can use standalone modules for repetitive tasks**

repetitive.js is a JavaScript library created to perform repetitive tasks. AJAX calls, manipulating DOM classes etc. - all the things you've probably done countless times before - now in a single library. Or not! repetitive.js is modularized - every function can be obtained as a standalone UMD module package.

## Installation

You can install this package from npm:
```bash
npm install repetitive
npm install --save repetitive
npm install --save-dev repetitive
```

Use in a browser:
```html
